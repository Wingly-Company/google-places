## Introduction 

This package provides a server side integration of Google Places services.
The following place requests are available: 
- [Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/autocomplete) 
- [Geocode](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) 
- [Details](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details)

## Installation 

First make sure to configure the repository in your composer.json by running:

```bash
composer config repositories.google-places vcs https://github.com/Wingly-Company/google-places
```

Then install the package by running:

```bash
composer require wingly/google-places
```

## Configuration 

This is the content of the config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * The api key used when sending requests to Google.
     */
    'google_api_key' => env('GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY'),

    /*
     * Here you may define the cache store that should be used to store
     * requests. This can be the name of any store that is
     * configured in app/config/cache.php
     */
    'cache_store' => env('GOOGLE_PLACES_DRIVER', 'file'),

    /*
     * This setting controls the default number of seconds responses must be cached.
     */
    'cache_lifetime' => env('GOOGLE_PLACES_CACHE_LIFETIME', 60 * 60 * 24 * 7),

    /**
     * This is the base URI path where Google places routes will be available from.
     */
    'path' => env('GOOGLE_PLACES_PATH', 'addresses'),
];
```

## Usage 

Here's how you can use the Google autocomplete.

```php 
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $results = GooglePlaces::autocomplete($request->input('query'))->get();

    return response()->json($results);
}
```

Here's how you can use the Google geocoding.

```php 
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $results = GooglePlaces::geocode($request->input('query'))->get();

    return response()->json($results);
}
```

Here's how you can use the Google place details.

```php 
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $results = GooglePlaces::details($request->input('place_id'))->get();

    return response()->json($results);
}
```

You can optionally configure your search parameters. 

### Language 
To get the results in a specific language: 

```php 
GooglePlace::autocomplete('par')->setLanguage('fr')->get();
GooglePlace::geocode('Paris, France')->setLanguage('fr')->get();
GooglePlace::details('ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4')->setLanguage('fr')->get();
```

### Country 
To limit the results in a specific country: 

```php 
GooglePlace::autocomplete('par')->setCountry('FR')->get();
GooglePlace::geocode('Paris, France')->setCountry('FR')->get();
```

### Types 
To restrict results for specific types (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table3): 

```php 
GooglePlace::autocomplete('par')->setTypes('(cities)')->get();
```

This option is available only for autocompletion.

### Fields 
To specify a list of place data types to be included in the response (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details#fields): 

```php 
$result = GooglePlaces::details('ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4')
    ->setFields('website,opening_hours')
    ->get();
```

This option is available only for place details.

## Addresses autocompletion and geocoding routes

The package exposes two routes that you can use for addresses autocompletion and geocoding under the following URL paths `/addresses/autocomplete`, `/addresses/geocode`. 

You can streamline your search by adding the following query params to your url: 
- `input`: The user entered input for the autocomplete or a full address for geocoding. 
- `language`: To get the results in a specific language. Defaults to the application current locale. 
- `country`: To get the results for a specific country. 
- `types`: To get the results for a specific type. Available only for autocomplete requests.
- `place_id`: (geocoding only) The place id returned by the autocomplete api. Will replace user input if provided.

If you like to prevent the publishing of those routes completely, you can use the `ignoreRoutes` method provided by GooglePlaces.  
Typically this method should be called in the register method of your `AppServiceProvider`: 

```php 
use Wingly\GooglePlaces\GooglePlaces;
 
/**
 * Register any application services.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function register()
{
    GooglePlaces::ignoreRoutes();
}
```
